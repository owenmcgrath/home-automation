**Home Automation**

Welcome to my implementation of connected home automation devices. The goal is to have:
- Various home automation devices (such as automated thermostats, automated lighting, home monitoring systems etc.)
- A server that drives communication between the devices and the outside world
- Applications for Command/Control from the outside world (android app, web portal)

Here are my requirements
- Devices must have both physical controls and IOT remote controls
- Everything must have a backup plan. (in case of no internet, no power)
- Software must be scalable for ease of additions of new devices and configurability
- Interfaces must be modern both physically and in software (no hacky electronics, bad UI)

In Progress
- Dual Control thermostat
- Server

To Do
- Android Application C2 Interface, with scheduling and monitoring
- Remote light switch
- Home network modifications

Maybes
- Motion aware/tracking device
- Automated outdoor spicket control (gardening etc)
- Enhanced energy usage & monitoring
- Machine learning
